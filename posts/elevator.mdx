summary: Have you ever wondered what would happen if we would make a vaccum tube
  and have some sort of elevator through Earth?
  How long would it take to go to the other side just with gravity?

# What if we would make an elevator through Earth?

## Short Answer

{/* TODO write */}

## How does gravity work inside of Earth?

Earth is more or less spherical and its density is more or less spherically symmetric.
That's why we can model its density and gravitational field in function of the distance from the center $r$ only.

Let's define:

- $B(r)$ is the ball of radius $r$
- $\partial B(r)$ is its surface so the sphere of radius $r$
- $\vec{g(r)}$ is the gravitational field at radius $r$
- $\rho(r)$ is the density at radius $r$
- $M(r)$ is the mass inside a sphere of radius $r$
- $R$ is Earth's radius

Now, we can apply [Gauss's law for gravity][1] to a sphere of radius $r$ inside Earth
and we can use the fact that the surface of a sphere of radius $r$ is $4 \pi r^2$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \oiint_{\partial B(r)} \vec{g(r)} \cdot d\vec{A} & = -4 \pi GM(r) \\
  \implies 4 \pi r^2 g(r) & = -4 \pi GM(r) \\
  \implies g(r) & = - \frac{GM(r)}{r^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

So now if we want to compute the gravitational field for a certain radius,
we need to know the amount of mass contained in the sphere of this radius.
For this, we can use the density data from the [Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM)][2]

### Mass

$$
\begin{aligned}
  M(r) & = \oiiint_{B(r)} \rho(r) d\vec{r} \\
  & = \int_0^R 4 \pi r^2 \rho(r) dr \\
  & = 4 \pi \int_0^R r^2 \rho(r) dr
\end{aligned}
$$

To estimate this integral, we are going to consider consecutive values of $r$ and $\rho$.
Let's call them $r_n$, $r_{n+1}$, $\rho_n$ and $\rho_{n+1}$.\
We compute the average value of $r^2$ between $r_n$, $r_{n+1}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \overline{r^2} & = \frac{1}{r_{n+1}-r_n} \int_{r_n}^{r_{n+1}} x^2 dx \\
  & = \frac{1}{r_{n+1}-r_n} \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{r_n}^{r_{n+1}} \\
  & = \frac{1}{3} \frac{r_{n+1}^3-r_n^3}{r_{n+1}-r_n}
\end{aligned}
$$

With this value, we can now integrate between $r_n$ and $r_{n+1}$
by adding $\overline{r^2} * \overline{\rho} * \left( r_{n+1} - r_n \right)$.

Here we take a moment to verify that our approximation is good enough.\
The current estimate of Earth's mass by science is $(5.9722 \pm 0.0006) \cdot 10^{24}$.\
The way I computed the integral gives me $5.9732 \cdot 10^{24}$ which is only $0.0004 \cdot 10^{24}$ away from the confidence interval.

### Gravitational Field

Now that finally have the mass, we can compute the gravitational field $|g(r)| = \frac{GM(r)}{r^2}$
