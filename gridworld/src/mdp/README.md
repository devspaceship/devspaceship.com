# mdp-rs

A Rust library for solving finite deterministic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

## Roadmap

- [ ] State Space
- [ ] Action Space
- [ ] Remove need for `get_all` method by having the state space and action space be given to the MDP at construction
- [ ] Implement value iteration
- [ ] Implement policy iteration
- [ ] Implement sarsa
- [ ] Implement q-learning
- [ ] State-dependent action spaces
- [ ] Stochastic next states
